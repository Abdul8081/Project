This is the implementation of the **cuckoo filter** in the **mgpusimu** Simulator, which has been builted over the **akita** framework.
In this, when request is coming from the tlb, it is going to have expensive search through the gmmu and if not found then it is going to the iommu, at this place, I have implemented cuckoofilter which will work for each request coming from the tlb, check if that if present in the cuckoo filter, then it will chek the if that is not the false postive then it will send the request to the to tlb else if it is false positive then it will do normal gmmu walk, othere wise if not found in the cuckoo filter then it is not present in the gmmu also, then it will **bypass gmmu walk** and send the request directly to the **iommu** to save the expenseve seach latency into the gmmu.
